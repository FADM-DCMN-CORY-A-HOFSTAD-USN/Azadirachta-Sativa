# Azadirachta-Sativa
Azadirachta indica, also known as the Neem plant has been traditionally used for naturopathic treatment of Helminths. Plants labeled as "Indica" are grown under low-pH conditions. Plants labeled as "Sativa" are grown under high-pH conditions. Farming Neem plants in high-pH environments yields high-power neem medicines which are more effective.

Azadirachta Sativa is less effective than chemical drugs used to kill helminths by a comparable margin. Azadirachta Sativa contains stronger molecular bonds than Azadrachta Indica via higher electron concentrations. Azadirachta Sativa molecules are denser, harder, more abrasive, and highly effective at breaking down helminth biology.
